Program that takes in a 24 character string and sets each character
to a location on the cube. The program also takes in a list of words.
The program then tries to see which of the words on the list can 
be found on the cube. Like boggle but on a 3d board.

PROJECT TITLE: Boggle Cube
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use a recursive algorithm to find words from a list on a 3d board.
AUTHORS: Ryan Egan
